    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A large language model is a type of AI that uses deep learning to understand and generate human language. Whereas a traditional software functions upon pre existing rules or codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** It means giving a set of instructions to a LLM. Prompting is important, as it is the only way a LLM understands what the user wants as a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** \n",
    " 1. Use clear and specific prompts <br>2. Provide context <br>3. Breaking down complex tasks.\n",

    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",

      "1. Create two buttons: one for \"1\" and another for \"0\". They should be placed next to each other on the calculator.\n",
      "2. Add a space between them: The space between the buttons should be a small distance so that we can easily press the buttons without pressing the space.\n",
